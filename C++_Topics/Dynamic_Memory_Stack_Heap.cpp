/*
Memory -> 2 types
i. Stack
ii. Heap (Dynamic memory)

Stack:
-> Compile time ( error in syntax are found during compilation )
-> Here compile time means when a program is compiled than it is allocated in stack memory 

Disadvantages of Stack:
-> allocates only that much memory which is required not more than that so memory when allocated during compile time is not changed during run time
-> removes the memory for the function after it returns for example if we want to return an array then the memory is removed after the function is returned so we do not have access to any elements of the array

Heap:
-> Run time ( error after running a program for example 2/0 )

# First compile then runs
